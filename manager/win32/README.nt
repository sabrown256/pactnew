To build PDBlib on Windows NT, using MS Visual C++ compiler and NMAKE:

1.  In pact/manager edit bmake.bat, replace %MANAGER% with the full path
    for your pact/manager directory.

2.  In pact/manager edit ld.nt, put the path to your pact/dev/lib directory
    after /LIBPATH:.

3.  In pact/manager edit make-def.nt, set RootDr to the path for your pact
    directory.

4.  In pact/manager, type: 
    pconfig win nt

    You should get messages about Makefiles being made and other configuration
    actions.

5.  In pact/manager, type:
    nmake pact

    This should cause the score, pml and pdb libraries to be built and
    installed in pact/dev/lib, and headers to be installed in pact/dev/include.

6.  To make the pdbtst program:
    in pact/pdb, type
    nmake pdbtst

    This creates pdbtst.exe.

    Type:
    pdbtst

    to run the test program.  If it doesn't complain of errors or differences
    you are finished.
