# CFG-BASE - common code to generate the main part of a config
#          - from OS, Compiler, and bits
#
# Source Version: 3.0
# Software Release #: LLNL-CODE-422942
#
# include "cpyright.h"
#

# NOTE: use node name for config file base
# if multiple hosts have the same SYS_TYPE there will be contention
# over the file - the node name is truly host specific
