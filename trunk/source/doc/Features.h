<H3>PACT can help you create programs that will run on most computers.</H3>

PACT has been tested on the following systems:
<UL>
<LI>AIX 2 and up
<LI>HP-UX
<LI>Irix 4.x
<LI>Irix 5.x
<LI>Linux 1.x
<LI>MAC OS X
<LI>OSF 1.x
<LI>SunOS 4.x
<LI>SunOS 5.x (Solaris)
<LI>Ultrix 
<LI>Unicos 7 and up
</UL>

<H3>PACT will help you create capabilities not available elsewhere</H3>

PACT is a hierarchy of modular functionalities with customizable and
extensible tools. PACT has the following features:
<UL>
<LI>  Multi-platform application support.
<LI>    Rapid prototyping.
<LI>    Portable, efficient binary data handling.
<LI>    Graphics system interfaces to X Window System, PostScript, and Computer
Graphics Metafile standards (CGM), PNG, and JPEG.
<LI>    Support for developing user-customizable Graphical User Interfaces.

<LI>    Portable interprocess communication and control for single CPUs,
networks, and parallel machines.
<LI>    Portable mathematics library including linear algebra routines and
abstract algebra support.
<LI>    Extensive support for generation, runtime, and post-processing
phases of numerical simulation codes.
<LI>    Portable SCHEME-dialect LISP interpreter and library for user
extensibility.
<LI>    Interpreter-level access and extensions to database, visualization,
simulation, and signal-processing functionality.
<LI>    Extensive signal processing capability including XY plotting.
<LI>    Portable, high-level, color graphics rendering including 
<A HREF="./Wireframe.html">wire-frame</A>,
<A HREF="./Fillpoly.html">polygon fills</A>, 
<A HREF="./Contour.html">contours</A>, surfaces, 
<A HREF="./Image.html">raster images</A> , and vectors.
<LI>    Tools for browsing, intelligent comparison, and graphical display
of the contents of binary data and picture files. 
</UL>

<A NAME="IDEAL"></A>
<H3>PACT is ideal for developing portable, numerical-simulation,
applied-science and engineering software.</H3>

PACT addresses portability issues related to data, graphics and
interprocess
communication. Advantages of using PACT are that it:
<UL>
  <LI>provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing portable
applications in one package.
  <LI>facilitates the creation of portable applications in a heterogeneous,
distributed computing environment.
  <LI>minimizes problems incurred while working with a wide variety of
different visualization software.
  <LI>helps target data to specific visualization software.
  <LI>gives automatic, transparent handling of word size and floating-point
representation differences.
  <LI>creates applications that compile and execute on a wide variety of
platforms including Macintosh, SUN3, SUN4, SGI, DEC 3100, IBM RS6000,
Solaris, Cray UNICOS and HP9000.
  <LI>lets you use the language of your choice to access its functionality.
</UL>
