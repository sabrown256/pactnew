For developers, moved and consolidated "most"
#define'd constants into named enum's.  This allows the
compiler to do better error checking and helps in debugging
where you see symbolic names rather than numerical values.


For end users, there are many, many new features:

1) ULTRA now has a fill command to allow you to color
   the area under curves or fill closed curves.

2) Colors can be expressed as RGB values in many
   contexts.  I intend to get them all in time.
   An RGB color is specified as:

      #x7frrggbb

   where r, g, and b above are hex digits.

3) If you do the following in your .ultrarc

   ld mouse.scm

   you can can control the viewport with the
   mouse.  The functionality is more or less modelled
   after the Google map and other similar usages.

4) PDBView can now look at PDB files inside TAR
   files or AR archives.  This currently works only
   with a serial version of PDBView

5) PDBView can read mySQL and SQLite databases.
   Writing capabilities will come next.  This capability
   depends on the appropriate libraries and headers
   being installed on the platform where PACT is built.

6) A rudimentary ability to write PDB files which are
   plain text.  This will be fully developed in future
   releases.

Collect PGS global attribute variables into struct and add
PG_get_attrs_glb, PG_set_attrs_glb, and PG_ptr_attrs_glb as the
sole accessors.  This keeps PGS state from conflicting with
applications or forcing them to change unnecessarily.

Divide headers into public and private parts.  The publics parts
have the old names (e.g. score.h).  The private parts have the
old name with _int added (e.g. score_int.h).  Move most of the
_XX variables and functions into the private headers to hide them
from applications which should use standard accessors in the
public parts.
