<H2>Welcome to the FAQ for PACT!</H2>

PACT is the environment and toolkit that we use to create portable 
applications, and to create functionality not readily available. 
PACT is our environment of choice for handling unique data,
portable computing environments, and the distributed computing 
arenas; and for converting data for the visualization application 
or algorithm of choice. We have created PACT to shield ourselves 
from new software, and hardware so we can concentrate on the 
applications at hand. PACT is beginning to emphasize design that 
takes advantage of massively parallel environments.
<P>
We would like to hear of your experiences with PACT. And, we would 
be especially pleased to try to add your mathematical, graphical, 
or other functionality to future distributions of PACT. 
<p>
<B>Absolute portability is our GOAL!</B> 
<P>
Most of the time we install PACT 
without problems, the other times take varying amounts of effort to 
track down. Usually the problems are simple, such as missing 
headers. If your experience with PACT is not absolute portability, 
we would like to hear from you so we can try to make it so. Please 
direct all portability issues to:

<H3>1) What is PACT?</H3>

PACT stands for Portable Application Code Toolkit. It is a
self-contained set of tools which support developing and
using portable programs particularly scientific and engineering
applications.  It attacks several portability problem areas:
<UL>
Binary Data
<BR>Graphics
<BR>Interprocess Communication
</UL>
PACT is composed of several specific packages
each of which address a specific functionality.
