		PACT Corporate Memory File

This file is to be a record of the thinking, objectives and
consensus of PACT developers about various important issues
that arise during the development process.

PACT threads:

	1.  From the application's point of view the API should
            be consistent for the SC_do_threads approach whether
            using a threadpool or new threads.

	2.  Should achieve n thread scaling, where n is the requested
            number of threads as specified through the API.

	3.  Participating threads (either pool or new) should have
	    indexes in the range of 0 through n-1.

	4.  It is still an open question as whether or not compatibility
	    with Open MP is desirable, and if so, how to define that.
	    In the current PACT implementation the major difference
	    is that PACT assigns a thread id of nthreads to the main
	    process, while Open MP uses id 0.  In parallel sections
	    under Open MP, the main process participates, while PACT
	    the SC_do_threads approach does not have the main process
	    participate.
